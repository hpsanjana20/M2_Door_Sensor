# Abstract

Door sensor for automated lighting fixtures manage is extensively being advanced for power saving and protection purposes. An infrared door sensor primarily based totally on electric and electronics combinational circuit generation is used to broaden the automated mild switching device. The automated mild switching device will cause power saving and green power utilization which can advantage each  individual. 

Furthermore, the device is advanced with protection surroundings while switching 'ON' or 'OFF' the light during room occupancy or unoccupancy. Apart from protection surroundings, it additionally incorporates guide switching in case person desires to have mild at some stage in the day. Basically, this device is designed to be established withinside the restroom.

A typical home user needs different type of light intensities at each location. Sometimes the light intensity from outside source is considered sufficient and the users do not need to turn on the light source. But there are situations where sometimes users turn on the light and leaves without turning off the light. These factors are considered one of the reasons that cause unnecessary energy wasting. 

Thus, indirectly causes increment in the utility cost. Therefore some alternatives are needed to control the energy conservation in a location in order to save energy and reduce the utility cost

Such automated room lighting fixtures may be applied to your garages, staircases, bathrooms, etc. in which we do not need continuous light but only when we are present.

Also, with the assist of an automated room mild manage device, you need not worry about electricity  because the lighting fixtures get routinely off while there may be no person.
